# Mental Health Benefits of Herbs for Vaping: Evidence, Mechanisms, and Usage Guidance

## Executive Summary

This report synthesizes the current clinical and mechanistic evidence for twelve popular herbs—ashwagandha, chamomile, lavender, peppermint, holy basil (tulsi), ginger, turmeric (curcumin), rosemary, passionflower, lemon balm, valerian root, and St. John’s wort—with a specific focus on their mental health benefits and implications for vaporized delivery. It triangulates human randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, meta-analyses, pharmacokinetic and device literature on vaping, and safety advisories to develop pragmatic, evidence-informed guidance for researchers, product developers, healthcare professionals, and informed consumers.

At a glance, the strongest human evidence supports:

- Ashwagandha for stress and anxiety reduction (meta-analysis of RCTs, moderate-to-large effect sizes, low certainty) and favorable effects on sleep and well-being in recent trials.[^2][^3][^4][^5]
- St. John’s wort for mild-to-moderate depression, with efficacy comparable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and a superior safety profile in meta-analyses; however, it carries a high interaction risk via CYP induction.[^11][^12][^13]
- Chamomile and lavender primarily via inhalation aromatherapy for anxiety reduction, supported by RCTs and systematic reviews; oral chamomile also shows anxiolytic effects in several trials.[^1][^8][^9][^10]
- Holy basil (tulsi) for stress reduction and stress-biomarker modulation in an 8-week RCT; clinical efficacy and safety reviews further support use in lifestyle-related stress.[^6][^7]
- Valerian, lemon balm, and passionflower, particularly in fixed combinations, for anxiety and sleep-related symptoms; real-world hospital data suggest reduced benzodiazepine co-prescription when such combinations are used.[^15]
- Ginger and rosemary for cognitive enhancement—ginger improved attention and memory in middle-aged women in an RCT; rosemary aroma shows cognitive performance correlations with systemic 1,8-cineole levels, and controlled human studies report mixed but directionally positive mood/cognition effects.[^22][^21][^20]
- Peppermint aroma and essential oil have promising pre-clinical cognitive benefits and some human signals; findings are heterogeneous and dose/context dependent.[^18][^19]
- Curcumin (turmeric) has robust mechanistic rationale and mixed but overall promising clinical effects in depression and anxiety; oral bioavailability is a central limitation, motivating exploration of inhaled delivery in future research.[^23][^24][^25]

Vaporization versus other routes: Inhalation via vaping generally avoids combustion-related toxins, reduces respiratory harm relative to smoking, and provides rapid onset and higher bioavailability than oral routes for volatile phytochemicals and cannabinoids in the cannabis literature.[^14][^26][^27] For non-cannabis herbs, temperature control is critical to volatilize active terpenes while minimizing thermal degradation. Based on aroma-therapy evidence and device guidance, plausible temperature bands are 100–125°C (212–257°F) for delicate aromatics (e.g., chamomile, lavender, lemon balm) and 130–150°C (266–302°F) for herbs where monoterpenes (e.g., 1,8-cineole, menthol) are relevant to cognitive or alertness effects.[^19][^18][^21][^29][^30]

Top usage recommendations and cautions:

- Ashwagandha: Consider oral extracts standardized to withanolides; dosing in trials typically 300–600 mg/day; potential endocrine effects caution in thyroid disease and pregnancy.[^2][^3][^5]
- Chamomile and lavender: Inhalation aromatherapy is well-supported; oral chamomile appears effective for anxiety; avoid high-heat vaping that can degrade beneficial volatiles; allergy cross-reactivity in Compositae-sensitive individuals.[^1][^8][^9]
- Tulsi: Extracts at 125 mg twice daily reduced stress and biomarkers; well-tolerated; may aid sleep and stress resilience.[^6][^7]
- Valerian/lemon balm/passionflower: Use as standardized extracts; fixed combinations show signals for anxiety/sleep and reduced benzodiazepine use in hospitalized patients; monitor sedation.[^15][^16][^17]
- St. John’s wort: Effective for mild-to-moderate depression; high interaction risk (CYP3A4, P-gp); avoid in bipolar depression; coordinate with prescribers.[^11][^12][^13]
- Ginger/rosemary/peppermint: Focus on cognitive targets; peppermint and rosemary aromas can modulate attention/memory; ginger oral 400–800 mg/day improved cognition; vaping should target volatile fractions with low-to-moderate temperatures.[^22][^21][^20][^18][^19]
- Curcumin: Use bioavailable formulations if oral; investigate inhalable delivery; watch for GI adverse effects; synergy with piperine noted but consider interaction potential.[^23][^24][^25]

Evidence gaps: Direct RCTs of vaporized non-cannabis herbs for mental health outcomes are scarce; herb-specific temperature and emissions data are limited; pharmacokinetic comparisons for inhaled delivery of many herbs remain unexplored; long-term safety and drug interaction risks in inhaled contexts are not well-characterized.

## Scope, Methods, and Source Quality

This analytical report covers twelve herbs frequently used in aromatherapy and herbal medicine—ashwagandha, chamomile, lavender, peppermint, holy basil, ginger, turmeric (curcumin), rosemary, passionflower, lemon balm, valerian root, and St. John’s wort—and their potential mental health benefits when used via vaporization. The analysis integrates:

- Peer-reviewed human studies (randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses).
- Mechanistic and pharmacokinetic evidence relevant to inhalation and vaporization.
- Device and route-of-administration literature, especially for cannabis (as a comparative model for inhalation pharmacokinetics and harm reduction).

Source prioritization: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were weighted highest, followed by double-blind RCTs, then mechanistic and device literature. Non–peer-reviewed texts and lay sources were excluded. An evidence grading rubric was applied to summarize study types, consistency, and observed effects across endpoints (anxiety, stress, sleep, mood, focus/cognition).

To orient readers, the following table maps source quality and how it informed conclusions.

To illustrate this prioritization, Table 1 summarizes the source quality grading used throughout the report.

The rubric guided evidence synthesis, ensuring that stronger sources drive key conclusions while mechanistic and device literature informs the vaping guidance.

## Inhalation/Vaping Rationale for Herbs

The respiratory delivery of botanicals leverages the lungs’ large surface area and capillary networks, enabling rapid alveolar absorption and near-immediate onset for volatile constituents. Compared with smoking, vaporization avoids combustion, dramatically reducing exposure to carbon monoxide and pyrolytic toxins (e.g., benzene, toluene), which are responsible for many respiratory harms. Compared with oral delivery, inhalation typically bypasses first-pass metabolism and provides higher bioavailability for volatile terpenes and cannabinoids, as illustrated in the cannabis literature.[^14][^27] For non-cannabis herbs rich in essential oils and monoterpenes, these pharmacokinetic advantages are especially relevant when seeking acute mood, anxiety, or cognitive effects.

In controlled studies, vaporized cannabis yielded higher blood THC concentrations than oral administration in some paradigms, and generally provided faster onset and shorter duration of subjective effects than smoking; nonetheless, both smoking and vaping produced stronger and more immediate effects than oral routes.[^27] Importantly, vaporization significantly reduced respiratory symptoms relative to smoking across multiple observational cohorts, supporting harm reduction benefits of switching from combustion to vaporization.[^14] These findings—while specific to cannabinoids—offer a rational template for non-cannabis herb vaporization: extract and inhale volatile fractions at controlled temperatures to achieve rapid systemic exposure while avoiding smoke-related toxins.

To clarify these trade-offs, Table 2 compares routes commonly used for herbal mental health applications.

Table 2. Route comparison—smoking vs vaping vs oral for botanical delivery

| Attribute                       | Smoking (combustion)                               | Vaping (vaporization)                                          | Oral (capsules, teas)                                             |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Onset                           | Rapid                                             | Rapid                                                           | Delayed (minutes to hours)                                        |
| Bioavailability                 | High for smokeable volatiles                      | High for volatiles; better than oral for many cannabinoids[^14][^27] | Variable; first-pass metabolism reduces bioavailability           |
| Duration                        | Shorter than oral; variable                       | Shorter than smoking in some paradigms[^27]                     | Longer, more sustained plasma profiles                            |
| Respiratory risks               | High (CO, tar, pyrolytic toxins)                  | Reduced respiratory harms vs smoking[^14]                       | None (respiratory)                                                |
| Dose control/titration          | Difficult; ad lib use common                      | Improved with temperature control and device design             | Predictable with labeled doses; slower titration                  |
| Suitability for volatiles       | Suitable but with toxic byproducts                | Suitable; preserves many volatiles if temperatures are controlled | Suitable for non-volatiles; poor for aroma-driven acute effects  |

Device and temperature control are central. Selecting temperature bands to volatilize target compounds (e.g., monoterpenes such as linalool, 1,8-cineole, menthol) while minimizing thermal decomposition is a key objective in herbal vaporization. As a practical guide for non-cannabis herbs, start with low-to-moderate temperatures to vaporize terpenes and delicate aromatics, avoiding combustion artifacts.

To operationalize this approach, Table 3 proposes pragmatic temperature bands by herb category, aligned with volatile constituents and device guidance.

Table 3. Temperature bands (°C/°F) for vaporizing herbs by dominant volatile class and intended effect

| Volatile class / Herb examples                      | Intended effect                    | Suggested temperature band         | Rationale and notes                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Delicate floral aromatics (chamomile, lavender)     | Anxiety reduction, relaxation      | 100–125°C (212–257°F)              | Preserves apigenin-related and linalool-rich fractions; avoids overheating that degrades volatiles[^1][^8][^29][^30] |
| Leafy успокоителни blends (lemon balm, valerian)     | Sleep onset, calm                  | 100–125°C (212–257°F)              | Targets tranquilizing terpenes; lower heat reduces harshness; monitor extraction efficiency[^15][^16][^29] |
| Monoterpene-rich cognitive enhancers (rosemary)     | Attention, memory                  | 130–150°C (266–302°F)              | Volatilizes 1,8-cineole; correlation with cognitive performance supports moderate heat[^21]               |
| Mint/menthol (peppermint)                           | Alertness, processing speed        | 130–150°C (266–302°F)              | Menthol and menthone volatilize in this range; heterogeneity in human outcomes warrants conservative starts[^19][^18] |
| Spice complexity (ginger)                           | Cognitive processing support       | 130–150°C (266–302°F)              | Mixed evidence for inhaled vs oral; lower heat preserves terpene fraction; oral RCT supports cognition[^22] |
| Anti-inflammatory polyphenols (turmeric/curcumin)  | Mood/depression (mechanistic)      | Explore via device-specific studies | Oral bioavailability is low; inhalable formulations plausible but understudied; avoid high heat degradation[^23] |

These bands are pragmatic, not prescriptive. Device performance, plant grind, and packing density all influence actual vaporization curves. Users should start at lower temperatures, observe flavor and vapor production, and incrementally adjust to avoid combustion and thermal degradation.

## Herb-by-Herb Evidence and Guidance

This section profiles each herb’s primary mental health benefits, the scientific evidence underpinning those effects, the potential for vaping to enhance absorption or delivery of actives, target conditions and populations, optimal usage recommendations, and key safety considerations.

### Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera)

Primary mental health benefits. Ashwagandha consistently reduces stress and anxiety across multiple RCTs and meta-analyses, with secondary signals for improved sleep and well-being. Mechanistic studies point to GABAergic modulation, HPA axis attenuation, and antioxidant effects.[^2][^3][^4][^5]

Scientific backing/studies. A dose–response meta-analysis of RCTs (12 studies, n=1,002) reported large reductions in stress (SMD −1.75; 95% CI −2.29, −1.22) and anxiety (SMD −1.55; 95% CI −2.37, −0.74), with favorable effects at oral doses of 300–600 mg/day; heterogeneity was high and evidence certainty low, warranting careful interpretation.[^2] Systematic reviews by the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements and independent analyses support these conclusions, emphasizing overall beneficial effects on stress and anxiety, with variability in formulations and outcomes.[^3][^4] A 2025 RCT also reported improvements in stress-related outcomes and sleep parameters with standardized root extract.[^5]

How vaping might enhance absorption. The primary actives (withanolides) are not highly volatile; oral delivery with standardized extracts is the dominant route in clinical studies. Inhalation may offer rapid systemic delivery of minor volatile fractions, but direct evidence is lacking. Given the pharmacokinetic advantages of inhalation for rapid onset, interest in inhalable formulations is plausible, yet untested in clinical trials.

Target conditions and populations. Stress and anxiety in adults seeking non-pharmaceutical options; sleep difficulties linked to stress; populations sensitive to sedative loads.

Optimal usage recommendations. Based on RCTs, oral standardized extracts in the 300–600 mg/day range (often divided) are typical; evening dosing may help sleep. Continue for at least 8 weeks to assess effects. If pursuing vaporization for aromatherapy-like effects, pair with oral supplementation rather than replace it.

Safety and contraindications. Generally well-tolerated. Potential endocrine effects (thyroid hormone modulation) suggest caution in thyroid disease; avoid during pregnancy.[^3]

To visualize the evidence, Table 4 summarizes key RCTs and meta-analytic findings.

Table 4. Ashwagandha RCTs and meta-analysis summary

| Study/type                          | Dose/duration                  | Outcomes                          | Effect size/notes                           | Certainty |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| Dose–response meta-analysis (12 RCTs)[^2] | 300–600 mg/day; 8–12 weeks     | Stress, anxiety                   | Stress SMD −1.75; Anxiety SMD −1.55         | Low      |
| ODS review (health professionals)[^3]      | Varied formulations             | Stress, anxiety, sleep            | Overall beneficial; evidence mixed          | Review   |
| 2025 RCT (Randomized, double-blind)[^5]    | Standardized root extract; 8–12 weeks | Stress, sleep                     | Significant improvements vs placebo         | RCT      |

### Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla)

Primary mental health benefits. Chamomile reduces anxiety symptoms in multiple populations and shows potential antidepressant effects. Sedation via apigenin’s modulation of GABA pathways is a plausible mechanism.[^1]

Scientific backing/studies. A 2024 systematic review of ten clinical trials concluded that oral chamomile (capsules or tea) improved anxiety in generalized anxiety disorder, insomnia, menstrual-related anxiety, and postmenopausal anxiety; most studies reported efficacy with favorable safety profiles.[^1]

How vaping might enhance absorption. Inhalation aromatherapy with chamomile essential oil has shown anxiolytic effects in RCTs of older adults and other populations, supporting rapid delivery via the olfactory–limbic route.[^8][^9] Vaporization can deliver volatile fractions without combustion, aligning with the aromatherapy paradigm; temperature control is critical to avoid degradation.

Target conditions and populations. Anxiety, stress-related somatic symptoms, and insomnia across diverse groups, including menopausal and elderly populations.

Optimal usage recommendations. Oral chamomile in trials ranged from 250–2,000 mg/day (capsules) or 1–2 cups of tea; inhalation sessions can be structured as 5–15 minutes of gentle aromatherapy. For vaping, start at 100–125°C (212–257°F), observe aroma quality, and avoid combustion.

Safety and contraindications. Generally safe; allergies to Compositae family members are possible, and potential interactions with anticoagulants and CNS depressants should be considered.[^1]

Table 5. Chamomile human studies overview

| Form/administration          | Dose                       | Duration     | Population                    | Outcome                                |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Capsules (various RCTs)[^1]  | 270 mg twice daily to 1,500 mg/day | 4–26 weeks | GAD, insomnia, menstrual, postmenopausal | Anxiety reduction; improved well-being |
| Tea (various RCTs)[^1]       | 1–2 cups daily             | 2–12 weeks   | Elderly, cancer patients      | Mixed; anxiety reduction in some studies |
| Inhalation aromatherapy[^8][^9] | Lavender + chamomile essential oil | RCTs; varied | Older adults; coronary patients | Reduced anxiety and stress             |

### Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia)

Primary mental health benefits. Lavender’s anxiolytic and stress-reduction effects are well-supported via inhalation aromatherapy; evidence extends to mood and stress biomarkers.

Scientific backing/studies. A systematic review found significant anxiety-reducing effects of lavender inhalation across eleven trials, implicating limbic system modulation (amygdala, hippocampus).[^9] A randomized controlled trial demonstrated reductions in depression, anxiety, and stress in community-dwelling older adults with lavender and chamomile inhalation.[^8] Reviews also note potential benefits in neurological conditions, including migraine and epilepsy, though these are broader than the present scope.[^10]

How vaping might enhance absorption. Inhalation of lavender essential oil via vaporization provides rapid, non-invasive delivery of linalool and linalyl acetate. For vaping, start at 100–125°C (212–257°F) to preserve delicate terpenes.

Target conditions and populations. Anxiety, acute stress, and relaxation; suitable for aromatherapy-focused protocols.

Optimal usage recommendations. Inhalation sessions of 5–15 minutes; consider pairing with gentle breathing exercises. Oral lavender oil capsules are also used clinically in some regions but are not the focus here.

Safety and contraindications. Generally well-tolerated; ensure purity of essential oils; avoid high-heat vaporization that may degrade terpenes.

Table 6. Lavender inhalation studies

| Study/type                         | Sample/population                 | Session length | Outcome                              |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Systematic review (11 trials)[^9]  | Mixed clinical contexts            | Varied         | Significant anxiety reduction        |
| RCT (older adults)[^8]             | Community-dwelling seniors         | Varied         | Reduced depression, anxiety, stress  |
| Neurological review[^10]           | Various neurological contexts      | Review         | Broad neurobiological plausibility   |

### Peppermint (Mentha × piperita)

Primary mental health benefits. Peppermint aroma has been associated with improved memory, alertness, and processing speed in some human studies; animal models of Alzheimer’s disease show cognitive benefits with peppermint essential oil sniffing, linked to antioxidant and neuroprotective effects.[^18][^19]

Scientific backing/studies. A 2022 study in APP/PS1 transgenic mice demonstrated improved learning and memory with peppermint essential oil sniffing, accompanied by reduced oxidative stress markers and normalized hippocampal neuronal status.[^18] Human evidence is heterogeneous, with some trials showing enhanced memory and alertness and others reporting insignificant effects; this underscores the importance of dose, context, and individual differences.[^19]

How vaping might enhance absorption. Inhalation delivers menthol and menthone rapidly to olfactory and systemic pathways. Temperature control (130–150°C / 266–302°F) is recommended to volatilize monoterpenes while avoiding thermal breakdown.

Target conditions and populations. Focus and alertness, cognitive support; potential applications in attention and processing speed.

Optimal usage recommendations. Begin with short inhalation sessions (5–10 minutes) at lower temperatures; titrate based on subjective effects and tolerability. Combine with workplace or study rituals to leverage expectancy and attention cues.

Safety and contraindications. Peppermint essential oil is generally safe when inhaled; concentration and dose should be conservative, especially in sensitive individuals. Avoid overheating.

| Model/population                 | Exposure                         | Cognitive outcome                          |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| AD mice (APP/PS1)[^18]           | 1 hour sniffing, 2×/day, 21 days | Improved memory; reduced oxidative stress  |
| Human aroma modulation[^19]      | Aroma exposure (varied)          | Mixed signals; peppermint enhanced memory in some paradigms |

### Holy Basil (Tulsi; Ocimum tenuiflorum)

Primary mental health benefits. Tulsi reduces stress and improves resilience, with evidence for modulation of stress biomarkers.

Scientific backing/studies. In a double-blind RCT (n=100), 125 mg twice daily of a standardized Ocimum tenuiflorum extract (Holixer) for 8 weeks significantly reduced perceived stress and improved acute stress responses across salivary cortisol, salivary amylase, and blood pressure, compared with placebo; improvements were evident from week 6.[^6] A clinical efficacy and safety review supports broader use in lifestyle-related chronic stress and stress-linked conditions.[^7]

How vaping might enhance absorption. Tulsi contains volatile terpenes amenable to inhalation; vaping may provide rapid anxiolytic and stress-relief effects. Temperature bands of 100–125°C (212–257°F) align with volatile release while protecting delicate compounds.

Target conditions and populations. Stress, anxiety, and sleep difficulties related to chronic stress; workplace stress and general anxiety.

Optimal usage recommendations. Oral extract 125 mg twice daily (based on RCT dosing); consider adjunctive aromatherapy via vaping for acute relief. Monitor blood pressure if using caffeine or other stimulants.

Safety and contraindications. Well-tolerated; single adverse event reports of increased agitation in one participant; general safety high in clinical settings.[^6]

| Hair cortisol (week 8)[^6]               | Higher (wide CI)              | Lower (significant)             | 0.03                  |
| Salivary cortisol/MAST (acute stress)[^6] | —                             | Lower                           | 0.001                 |
| Systolic/diastolic BP (acute stress)[^6] | —                             | Lower                           | 0.010/0.025           |

### Ginger (Zingiber officinale)

Primary mental health benefits. Ginger enhances attention and cognitive processing capabilities in healthy, middle-aged women, with signals in working memory and reaction times.

Scientific backing/studies. A double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT (n=60) found that 800 mg/day of ginger extract for two months significantly improved working memory, attention, and speed/quality of memory; changes in event-related potentials (N100 and P300) supported enhanced attention and cognitive processing.[^22]

How vaping might enhance absorption. Gingerols and shogaols include volatile fractions; inhalation may deliver rapid effects for alertness or cognitive processing support. However, clinical evidence is primarily oral; vaping should be considered complementary for aroma-driven focus, with temperature bands around 130–150°C (266–302°F).

Target conditions and populations. Focus, attention, and processing speed, particularly in middle-aged adults; fatigue-related cognitive sluggishness.

Optimal usage recommendations. Oral ginger 400–800 mg/day improved cognition in the RCT; vaping can be explored for immediate alertness via aroma, with conservative starts and monitoring.

Safety and contraindications. Generally safe; watch for GI discomfort and potential interaction with anticoagulants at higher oral doses.[^22]

### Turmeric/Curcumin (Curcuma longa)

Primary mental health benefits. Curcumin demonstrates antidepressant and anxiolytic effects through anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective pathways, with mixed human trial outcomes due to low oral bioavailability.[^23][^24][^25]

Scientific backing/studies. A 2024 comprehensive review highlighted curcumin’s modulation of neurotransmitter systems, HPA axis, and neurogenesis, and reported multiple RCTs showing benefit in major depressive disorder and anxiety; however, heterogeneity and bioavailability limit decisive conclusions.[^23] Systematic reviews corroborate antidepressant effects with variable magnitude, and clinical guidance notes multi-target pharmacology but calls for better formulations and standardized dosing.[^24][^25]

How vaping might enhance absorption. Oral bioavailability is a persistent challenge; inhaled delivery could bypass first-pass metabolism and deliver curcumin particles or aerosolized formulations directly to the lungs, but clinical evidence is lacking. Device studies are needed to determine safe temperature ranges that avoid thermal degradation while enabling systemic absorption.

Target conditions and populations. Depression and anxiety, especially with comorbid inflammation; populations sensitive to GI side effects from oral high-dose curcumin.

Optimal usage recommendations. In oral trials, doses from 500–1,000 mg/day (often with piperine or bioavailable formulations) have been used; if inhaled, ensure pharmaceutical-grade raw materials and device validation to avoid thermal breakdown; monitor for GI complaints in oral protocols.

Safety and contraindications. Generally well-tolerated; GI adverse effects at higher oral doses; potential interaction with anticoagulants; piperine co-administration can increase absorption but requires caution for drug interactions.[^23][^24][^25]

### Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis)

Primary mental health benefits. Rosemary aroma enhances memory and attention; plasma 1,8-cineole correlates with cognitive performance in controlled studies.

Scientific backing/studies. In a controlled study, cognitive performance correlated with blood levels of 1,8-cineole following rosemary aroma exposure, implicating this monoterpene in attention and memory processes.[^21] Human trials of oral rosemary extract report improvements in mood, fatigue, and cognitive function in working adults.[^20]

How vaping might enhance absorption. Inhalation of volatile 1,8-cineole at moderate temperatures (130–150°C / 266–302°F) can achieve rapid brain uptake via olfactory and systemic routes. Device guidance suggests starting at moderate temperatures to balance extraction and safety.

Target conditions and populations. Focus, memory, and mental clarity; study and work contexts.

Optimal usage recommendations. Aroma-focused sessions of 5–15 minutes at 130–150°C; titrate based on task demands and sensitivity. Consider pairing with oral rosemary extract in research settings for additive cognitive effects.

Safety and contraindications. Generally safe; avoid high temperatures that may degrade terpenes or produce irritants.

| Study/type                         | Intervention                 | Cognitive/mood outcomes                        |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Plasma 1,8-cineole correlation[^21] | Rosemary aroma exposure      | Performance correlated with 1,8-cineole levels |
| Continuous intake (working adults)[^20] | Rosemary extract (oral)     | Improved mood states, fatigue, and cognition   |

### Passionflower (Passiflora incarnata)

Primary mental health benefits. Passionflower is used for anxiety and sleep support, with evidence of GABAergic activity and clinical anxiolytic effects.

Scientific backing/studies. A 2020 systematic review summarized clinical trials showing anxiolytic efficacy and sedating properties, with typical doses ranging from 45 drops/day of liquid extract to 90 mg in specific formulations; mechanisms include modulation of GABA currents.[^17]

How vaping might enhance absorption. Inhalation of volatile fractions may support acute anxiolysis. Temperature bands should be low-to-moderate (100–125°C / 212–257°F) to preserve delicate aromatics.

Target conditions and populations. Anxiety and insomnia; potential to reduce benzodiazepine reliance when used in combinations.

Optimal usage recommendations. Standardized extracts in the 200–500 mg range are common; consider fixed combinations with valerian and lemon balm for sleep and anxiety. Inhalation sessions can be used before bedtime.

Safety and contraindications. Generally well-tolerated; sedation risk; caution when combined with CNS depressants.[^17]

Table 12. Passionflower clinical outcomes and mechanisms

| Study/type                   | Dose/route                  | Outcome                     | Mechanism notes                   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Systematic review (2020)[^17] | 45 drops/day to 90 mg (extract) | Reduced anxiety             | GABAergic modulation              |
| GABA currents (in vitro)[^17] | Extracts on hippocampal neurons | Increased GABA currents     | Supports anxiolytic plausibility  |

### Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis)

Primary mental health benefits. Lemon balm is used for anxiety and sleep support, often in combinations with valerian and passionflower.

Scientific backing/studies. A fixed combination (Ze 185) containing valerian, lemon balm, passionflower, and butterbur was associated with reduced benzodiazepine prescribing in hospitalized psychiatric patients, suggesting anxiolytic and sleep-promoting utility.[^15] Evidence for cognitive effects is limited, but aromatic properties support calm and focus.

How vaping might enhance absorption. Inhalation delivers volatile fractions for rapid anxiolysis; low-temperature vaporization (100–125°C / 212–257°F) is appropriate.

Target conditions and populations. Anxiety and sleep; hospital settings where benzodiazepine stewardship is important.

Optimal usage recommendations. Standardized extracts; combinations with valerian and passionflower align with traditional and hospital practice. Inhalation sessions for pre-sleep routines.

Safety and contraindications. Sedation; monitor when combined with other sedatives; review individual herb interactions within fixed combinations.[^15][^16]

Table 13. Lemon balm combination (Ze 185) evidence

| Study/type                         | Components/dose                 | Clinical outcomes                              | Benzodiazepine co-prescription signal |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Retrospective case-control (Ze 185)[^15] | Valerian, lemon balm, passionflower, butterbur; 1 tablet 3×/day | Improved anxiety/sleep items; comparable effectiveness | Reduced benzodiazepine prescriptions  |

### Valerian Root (Valeriana officinalis)

Primary mental health benefits. Valerian is widely used as a sleep aid and for anxiety; evidence is mixed across trials.

Scientific backing/studies. A 2020 systematic review of plant extracts for sleep disturbances found inconsistent outcomes for valerian across trials, reflecting heterogeneity in preparations and endpoints.[^16] Combination therapy signals, including Ze 185, support its role in sleep and anxiety management.[^15]

How vaping might enhance absorption. Volatile fractions (e.g., sesquiterpenes) may contribute to sedation via olfactory and systemic routes; low temperatures (100–125°C / 212–257°F) are suitable.

Target conditions and populations. Insomnia and anxiety; older adults and hospitalized patients with sleep disturbances.

Optimal usage recommendations. Standardized extracts; consider combinations with lemon balm and passionflower. Inhalation in the evening can complement oral supplementation.

Safety and contraindications. Sedation and next-day drowsiness; caution with other sedatives and when operating machinery.[^16]

| Combination (Ze 185)[^15]         | Fixed combination; 3×/day | Improved sleep/anxiety items    | Benzodiazepine-sparing effect      |

### St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)

Primary mental health benefits. St. John’s wort is effective for mild-to-moderate depression, with meta-analyses showing comparable efficacy to SSRIs and a superior safety profile.

Scientific backing/studies. A 2016 meta-analysis (27 studies, n=3,126) found similar clinical response, remission, and HAMD score reductions for St. John’s wort extract and SSRIs, with significantly fewer adverse events and lower withdrawals due to adverse events in the St. John’s wort group.[^11] A randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial (WS 5570) supported efficacy in major depression vs placebo.[^12] A 2001 JAMA study found St. John’s wort ineffective for major depression, underscoring the importance of diagnosis and product standardization.[^13]

How vaping might enhance absorption. The active constituents (hyperforin, hypericin) are not primarily volatile; oral extracts are the evidence-based route. Vaping is not recommended for St. John’s wort given the lack of evidence for inhaled delivery and the importance of standardized oral dosing.

Target conditions and populations. Mild-to-moderate depression; populations prioritizing tolerability; clinical contexts where drug interaction risks can be managed.

Optimal usage recommendations. Use standardized extracts (e.g., LI-160, WS 5570) at doses used in RCTs; monitor for drug interactions. Coordinate with prescribers.

Safety and contraindications. Significant CYP3A4 and P-gp induction leads to numerous drug interactions; avoid in bipolar depression (risk of mania); photosensitivity possible. Inhaled delivery is not supported by evidence and may introduce variability.[^11][^12][^13]

Table 15. St. John’s wort meta-analytic comparison vs SSRIs

| Outcome                      | St. John’s wort vs SSRIs        | Safety profile                        |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Clinical response/remission[^11] | Comparable                      | Fewer adverse events; fewer withdrawals |
| HAMD reduction[^11]          | Comparable                      | —                                      |
| WS 5570 RCT (major depression)[^12] | Superior to placebo            | Well-tolerated                        |
| JAMA (major depression)[^13] | Not effective                   | —                                      |

## Safety, Contraindications, and Drug Interactions

Safety profiles differ markedly across herbs and delivery methods. Oral supplements and standardized extracts are generally well-tolerated, but several considerations apply:

- St. John’s wort: High interaction risk due to CYP3A4 and P-gp induction, affecting many medications (e.g., antidepressants, anticoagulants, oral contraceptives). Avoid in bipolar depression.[^11][^12][^13]
- Chamomile: Potential allergen; cross-reactivity in Compositae-sensitive individuals; possible interaction with anticoagulants and CNS depressants.[^1]
- Valerian/lemon balm/passionflower: Sedation risk; caution with benzodiazepines, hypnotics, and alcohol; monitor in older adults and hospitalized populations.[^15][^16]
- Curcumin: GI adverse effects at higher oral doses; potential interaction with anticoagulants; piperine can increase absorption but may alter drug metabolism.[^23][^24][^25]
- Ashwagandha: Potential thyroid hormone modulation; caution in thyroid disease; avoid in pregnancy.[^3]

Inhalation-specific considerations: Avoid combustion; choose temperature bands to preserve volatiles and minimize degradation products; ensure product purity and correct labeling; adhere to facility policies on device use. While vaping reduces respiratory harm compared with smoking, it is not risk-free, and product quality is paramount.[^14]

To support clinical decision-making, Table 16 provides a drug interaction and contraindication matrix by herb.

| Tulsi[^6][^7]        | Limited adverse signals; blood pressure interactions                  | Low      | Monitor BP if using stimulants; generally well-tolerated                        |

## Usage Recommendations and Protocol Templates

Evidence-informed protocols should align endpoints (anxiety, stress, sleep, mood, focus) with appropriate herbs, routes, and timing. For each protocol, begin with conservative dosing and titrate based on response and tolerability.

Table 17 summarizes recommended usage by herb and target condition.

Table 17. Recommended usage by herb and target condition

| Target condition | Herb(s)                      | Route                   | Dose range from evidence                  | Timing                       | Notes                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Anxiety          | Chamomile, lavender          | Inhalation; oral        | Inhalation 5–15 min; oral 270 mg–1,500 mg/day | Morning or as needed         | Start with low temp (100–125°C); oral capsules for daily coverage[^1][^8][^9] |
| Stress           | Ashwagandha, tulsi           | Oral; inhalation        | Ashwagandha 300–600 mg/day; tulsi 125 mg BID | Morning/evening              | Pair oral extracts with short inhalation sessions for acute relief[^2][^3][^6] |
| Sleep            | Valerian, lemon balm, passionflower | Oral; inhalation        | Valerian/lemon balm/passionflower combinations | 30–60 min before bedtime     | Fixed combinations show benzodiazepine-sparing signals; low-temp vaping[^15][^16] |
| Mood/depression  | St. John’s wort              | Oral (standardized)     | As per RCTs (e.g., LI-160, WS 5570)       | Morning                      | Monitor drug interactions; avoid in bipolar depression[^11][^12][^13] |
| Focus/cognition  | Rosemary, peppermint, ginger | Inhalation; oral        | Rosemary/peppermint: aroma sessions; ginger 400–800 mg/day | Pre-task (inhalation); daily (oral) | Moderate temps (130–150°C) for cognitive terpenes; oral ginger supports processing speed[^21][^19][^22] |

Temperature and session templates by effect profile are provided in Table 18.

Table 18. Temperature and session templates

| Effect profile          | Temperature band         | Session length | Repetition                       |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Calming/anxiolysis      | 100–125°C (212–257°F)    | 5–15 min       | 1–3 sessions/day as needed       |
| Sleep onset             | 100–125°C (212–257°F)    | 10–20 min      | Single evening session           |
| Alertness/focus         | 130–150°C (266–302°F)    | 5–15 min       | 1–2 sessions pre-task            |
| Complex blends          | 100–125°C or 130–150°C   | 5–15 min       | Tailored to herb mix and goal    |

These templates are pragmatic starting points. Users should titrate temperature within bands to optimize flavor and vapor production, avoid combustion, and align with individual sensitivity and task demands.

## Research Gaps and Future Directions

Despite promising signals, several evidence gaps constrain clinical and product development decisions:

- Direct RCTs of vaporized non-cannabis herbs for mental health outcomes are scarce. Most human evidence is oral or inhalation aromatherapy; few trials test dry-herb vaporization for anxiolytic or cognitive endpoints.
- Herb-specific vaporization temperature curves and emissions data are limited. Device and product guidance relies on general terpene volatilization principles and cannabis literature.
- Pharmacokinetics of inhaled non-cannabis phytochemicals (e.g., linalool, 1,8-cineole, menthol, withanolides) require systematic characterization to define dose–response and therapeutic windows.
- Long-term safety of vaping herbs—including cumulative respiratory, cardiovascular, and cognitive effects—remains understudied, especially relative to oral and aromatherapy routes.
- Drug–herb interaction risks in inhaled contexts may differ from oral routes due to rapid onset and peak levels; clinical guidance must be updated with PK data.

To organize future research, Table 19 outlines a priority agenda.
