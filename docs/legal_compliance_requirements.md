# Legal and Compliance Requirements for Selling Herbal Products for Mental Health (U.S.-Focused, E-Commerce)

## Executive Summary

Herbal and dietary supplements occupy a uniquely constrained position in U.S. law: they are regulated as foods, not drugs, and therefore may not claim to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. This rule applies with particular force to mental health contexts, where casual references to “anxiety,” “depression,” “insomnia,” or related conditions are treated as disease claims and are prohibited on product labels and in advertising. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines the line between permissible structure/function claims—describing how a nutrient or dietary ingredient affects normal body structure or function—and impermissible disease claims; the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) polices advertising for truthfulness and requires competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate health benefits. Together, these regimes create a narrow corridor in which mental health–related marketing must operate if the product is to remain a supplement rather than an unapproved drug.[^2][^5][^3]

This guide translates those legal boundaries into practical controls for e-commerce brands selling herbal products targeted at mental well-being. The rules that most directly shape day-to-day operations are:

- FDA’s dietary supplement framework, including the mandatory DSHEA disclaimer for structure/function claims and strict limits on disease claims;[^1][^2]
- FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR Part 111, which mandate quality systems for identity, purity, strength, and composition;[^4]
- FTC’s Health Products Compliance Guidance, which sets a high substantiation bar for any health benefit claims and requires clear and conspicuous disclosures where needed to avoid consumer deception;[^5]
- State age-restriction trends for certain categories (e.g., weight loss, muscle-building), with mental-health positioning sometimes implicating these rules;[^14]
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA, as amended by CPRA) obligations for privacy notices, consumer rights, and honoring Global Privacy Control (GPC);[^10]
- The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) constraints on collecting personal data from children under 13;[^12]
- FDA import/export responsibilities for international shipments.[^7]

The top enforcement triggers are straightforward: making disease claims (explicitly or implicitly), implying FDA approval, failing to include the DSHEA disclaimer when required, lacking adequate substantiation for health benefits, and omitting material safety or limitation disclosures in advertising. The immediate compliance actions are equally clear: (1) implement a claims review SOP that screens all labels, web pages, social posts, and influencer content against FDA/FTC standards; (2) deploy a compliant Supplement Facts panel and DSHEA disclaimer; (3) operationalize CCPA and COPPA privacy controls, including GPC; (4) enforce CGMPs and vendor qualification; and (5) prepare a 30-day structure/function claim notification workflow for FDA.[^1][^2][^5][^10][^12][^4]

Information gaps remain that should be addressed as the program matures: ingredient-specific restrictions (e.g., St. John’s wort, kava, melatonin, CBD) are not fully detailed here and require additional research; detailed EU, UK, Canada, and Australia import rules are beyond this guide’s scope; and the precise format of FDA’s structure/function claim notifications can be refined by consulting the notification guidance.[^15]

## Regulatory Landscape: FDA vs. FTC Roles and the DSHEA Framework

The U.S. regulatory architecture for supplements divides responsibilities between FDA and FTC. FDA governs product definition, labeling, and manufacturing quality, while FTC governs advertising truthfulness and substantiation. In practice, both agencies examine the same marketing materials from different angles: FDA looks for misbranding and impermissible disease claims; FTC looks for deceptive claims and inadequate support.

Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), supplements are not pre-approved by FDA, and firms bear the responsibility to ensure their products are not adulterated or misbranded. The labeling play—where the DSHEA disclaimer appears, the contents of the Supplement Facts panel, and the careful selection of claims—determines whether a product is lawfully marketed as a dietary supplement or drifts into drug territory. FTC standards overlay this picture by insisting on competent and reliable scientific evidence, the totality of reliable evidence, and clear disclosures where needed to prevent consumer deception.[^2][^5]

### FDA Foundations: DSHEA, Labeling, and Claim Categories

DSHEA places the burden on firms to market supplements that are safe, properly manufactured, and truthfully labeled. The statute creates a limited safe harbor for structure/function claims—statements about how a nutrient or ingredient affects normal body structure or function—provided the claim is truthful and not misleading, and the label bears the FDA-mandated disclaimer. FDA does not pre-approve these claims, and firms must have substantiation to support them.[^2]

FDA distinguishes among three main claim types for supplements and conventional foods: health claims (generally require FDA authorization and must meet the Significant Scientific Agreement standard), nutrient content claims (characterizing the level of a nutrient), and structure/function claims. For supplements, structure/function and well-being claims require the DSHEA disclaimer on the label. General well-being claims and classical nutrient deficiency disease claims are also permissible if properly substantiated and accompanied by the disclaimer; deficiency disease claims must also disclose the prevalence of the condition in the United States.[^2][^9]

In mental health contexts, this classification matters because even subtle references to psychiatric conditions are treated as disease claims and are prohibited unless phrased to describe support of normal structure or function without implying treatment or prevention. A compliant supplement might state that an ingredient “supports relaxation as part of a healthy lifestyle,” but it may not claim to “treat anxiety.”[^2]

### FTC Advertising Oversight: Substantiation and Disclosures

FTC’s Health Products Compliance Guidance rejects category-based shortcuts. Regardless of whether the product is a food, supplement, or other health-related product, advertisers must possess competent and reliable scientific evidence—often randomized, controlled human clinical trials—when they make health benefit claims. The evidence must be relevant to the advertised benefit, formulation, dosage, and population. Advertisers are responsible for both express and implied claims, which the FTC interprets based on the net impression conveyed to reasonable consumers. Where an ad omits material limitations or risks, or overstates scientific certainty, it can be deceptive even if no false statement was made. Importantly, the DSHEA disclaimer appears on labels; it is not a cure-all for advertising that otherwise misleads consumers about disease treatment or efficacy.[^5]

## Product Classification and Manufacturing Quality (21 CFR Part 111)

Remaining within the dietary supplement classification requires attention to identity, composition, and process controls. The CGMP rule in 21 CFR Part 111 sets minimum good manufacturing practice requirements for persons who manufacture, package, label, or hold dietary supplements. It requires qualified personnel, appropriate facilities and sanitation, validated production and process controls, and robust quality assurance. Among other duties, firms must establish specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of incoming ingredients and finished products, confirm specifications through appropriate testing, investigate deviations, and maintain batch records that enable traceability. FDA’s small entity compliance guide clarifies how to implement these requirements in practice and is a useful resource for scaling quality programs without overburdening operations.[^4][^13]

These requirements are not theoretical: they are the baseline expectations for any lawful supplement. For mental-health–positioned products, the same rules apply irrespective of the marketing narrative. Strong quality controls reduce recall and enforcement risk, and they also help substantiate advertising claims by ensuring product consistency and dose fidelity across batches.

## Allowed vs. Prohibited Claims for Mental Health

The line between permissible and impermissible claims is critical. A claim that an herbal product “supports cognitive function” or “promotes relaxation as part of a balanced lifestyle” can be permissible structure/function messaging when it describes support of normal function and is properly qualified. A claim that the same product “treats anxiety,” “prevents depression,” or “cures insomnia” is a disease claim and is prohibited. The FTC and FDA converge on this distinction: advertisers must avoid implied disease claims, and labels cannot cross the disease line. When a statement is ambiguous, both agencies consider the overall impression on a reasonable consumer, including product names, images, and surrounding context.[^2][^5][^1]

To illustrate these boundaries, the following table provides examples of compliant and noncompliant mental health–related statements. This should be read as practical guidance; the legal analysis turns on the full context and the net impression conveyed.

Table 1. Claim Boundary Examples: Compliant vs. Noncompliant Statements

| Context | Compliant (Structure/Function) | Noncompliant (Disease) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Focus on normal function | “Supports a calm, focused mind as part of a healthy lifestyle.” | “Treats anxiety and panic attacks.” | Disease reference triggers drug classification. |
| General well-being | “Promotes relaxation during stressful times.” | “Prevents depression.” | Avoids disease diagnosis and treatment. |
| Nutrient deficiency | “Helps address occasional sleeplessness due to low magnesium levels.” | “Cures insomnia.” | If framed as deficiency, include prevalence statement; avoid disease framing. |
| Cognitive support | “Supports memory and concentration in healthy adults.” | “Prevents Alzheimer’s disease.” | Avoids disease prevention claims. |
| Mechanism description | “Contains an ingredient that helps maintain normal neurotransmitter balance.” | “Corrects neurotransmitter deficiencies that cause anxiety.” | Mechanism language must not imply disease treatment. |

The labels and advertising should not only avoid prohibited disease claims but also refrain from implying FDA approval. Firms must not suggest that inclusion of the DSHEA disclaimer signals endorsement by FDA; the disclaimer, in fact, communicates the opposite—that the product has not been evaluated by FDA for disease claims. Disclaimers do not excuse deceptive advertising, and overstatement remains actionable.[^5]

### Disclaimers and Notifications

When a label includes a structure/function claim, general well-being claim, or a claim about a classical nutrient deficiency disease, the DSHEA disclaimer is required in a specific format. Under 21 CFR 101.93, the disclaimer must state: “This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” If multiple qualifying statements appear, the plural form (“These statements…”) is used. The disclaimer must appear adjacent to the claim or be linked with a symbol that refers to the same symbol next to the disclaimer. It must be prominently presented in boldface type no smaller than 1/16 inch. If the disclaimer is not adjacent to the claim, it must be set off in a box. The rule also requires that the disclaimer appear on each panel or page where the claim appears in product labeling such as pamphlets or catalogs.[^1]

Firms that market supplements with structure/function or related claims must also notify FDA about the content of the claim no later than 30 days after first marketing, in accordance with the notification requirements in 21 CFR 101.93. The notification includes firm details, the text of the claim, and the name of the dietary ingredient and product, and must be signed by a responsible individual who can certify accuracy and completeness. Separately, FDA’s notifications guidance for structure/function and related claims provides procedural details to help firms comply.[^1][^15]

Beyond the mandatory DSHEA disclaimer, FTC guidance requires clear and conspicuous disclosures in advertising whenever necessary to prevent deception—such as material limitations on benefits or significant safety risks. For instance, if study results only apply to a specific population or dose, advertising should say so in simple language placed near the claim. If an ad suggests rapid effects or broad symptom relief, but the evidence shows only modest benefits for certain individuals, that limitation should be disclosed in a way that is noticeable and understandable to ordinary consumers.[^5]

## Age Restrictions and Requirements

There is no federal law that generally restricts the sale of dietary supplements to adults, but states have moved to limit access to certain product categories—most notably weight loss and muscle-building supplements—to minors. A recent trend involves retail controls such as placing products behind the counter or in restricted areas. Some laws explicitly target products marketed for weight loss or muscle building; however, if mental-health–positioned products overlap with these categories, they can be captured. Businesses selling online should treat these developments as signals to strengthen age gating, in-store controls, and staff training.[^14]

Table 2. Selected State Age Restriction Trends (Illustrative)

| State | Product Categories Affected | Age Threshold | Key Retailer Requirements | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| New York | Weight loss and muscle-building supplements | Under 18 | No specific retailer control in the referenced material; law in effect as of April 2024 | In effect |
| Virginia | Certain weight loss and muscle-building products | Under 18 | Keep products out of customer reach (e.g., behind the counter) | Introduced Jan 8, 2025 |
| Texas | Certain weight loss and muscle-building products | Under 18 | Keep products out of customer reach | Proposed (November) |
| New Hampshire | Certain weight loss and muscle-building products | Under 18 | Not specified in referenced material | Pre-filed |

As a practical matter, brands and retailers should monitor state-level developments and adjust point-of-sale and fulfillment practices accordingly. This includes evaluating product positioning and claims to avoid unintended coverage under broad categorical restrictions.[^14]

### Minors and Mental Health Positioning

Mental-health–positioned products do not automatically trigger age restrictions. However, where a product is marketed both for mood support and for weight management or performance enhancement, state laws may apply. A conservative compliance posture includes age gating at checkout, shipping controls for high-risk categories, and clear communications to retail partners about storage and display practices. Where feasible, firms should consider “adults only” labels for categories at higher risk of state restrictions and ensure customer support scripts reflect these policies.[^14]

## E-Commerce Privacy Policy Requirements

Privacy obligations for e-commerce are not optional. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), applies to many online retailers that meet certain thresholds and grants California residents substantial rights over their personal information. Businesses must provide Notice at Collection that describes categories of personal information collected and the purposes for which they are used, maintain a comprehensive Privacy Policy that explains rights and how to exercise them, and honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals as valid opt-out requests for sale or sharing. Consumer rights include the right to know, delete, correct, opt out of sale/sharing, and limit use of sensitive personal information, subject to statutory exceptions and verification requirements. CCPA sets response timelines—45 days (extendable) for most rights, and 15 business days for opt-out requests—and prohibits discrimination against consumers who exercise their rights. Data breaches involving nonencrypted, nonredacted personal information can trigger statutory damages.[^10]

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) applies to websites and online services directed to children under 13 and imposes specific requirements on the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from children. In general, operators must provide notice and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13, with limited exceptions. For supplement e-commerce, the practical implication is to avoid directing marketing to children, limit tracking technologies on child-directed pages, and ensure that any collection from minors is compliant. The FTC’s recent updates strengthen protections and signal a more assertive enforcement posture.[^12]

HIPAA typically does not apply to retail supplement sellers because HIPAA covers covered entities and business associates handling protected health information in the context of healthcare operations. Even so, firms should be cautious about handling sensitive user-provided information (e.g., health questionnaires, chat transcripts) and ensure that any health-related data is processed in accordance with stated privacy policies and applicable laws.[^10]

To help teams operationalize CCPA compliance, the following tables outline the timeline and operational channel requirements.

Table 3. CCPA Consumer Rights and Business Response Timelines

| Right | Statutory Timeline | Notable Operational Details |
|---|---|---|
| Right to Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing | 15 business days | Must honor GPC as a valid opt-out; provide “Do Not Sell or Share” link if applicable |
| Right to Know | 45 calendar days (extendable to 90) | Disclose categories/specific pieces, sources, purposes, and third-party disclosures for preceding 12 months |
| Right to Delete | 45 calendar days (extendable to 90) | Verify identity; certain exceptions apply |
| Right to Correct | 45 calendar days (extendable to 90) | Verify identity; certain exceptions apply |
| Right to Limit Use of Sensitive PI | 45 calendar days (extendable to 90) | Limit use to necessary service provision; sensitive PI includes SSN, financial account info, precise geolocation |

Table 4. CCPA Notice at Collection and Opt-Out Link Implementation

| Element | Minimum Content | Placement Examples | GPC Considerations |
|---|---|---|---|
| Notice at Collection | Categories of personal information collected; purposes for which categories are used; link to Privacy Policy; if selling/sharing, include “Do Not Sell or Share” link | Website homepage or order page; mobile app settings; printed forms in retail | GPC signal must be honored as a valid opt-out of sale/sharing |
| Privacy Policy | Comprehensive description of collection, use, sharing, sale; how to exercise rights; data retention and security | Footer link sitewide; app settings; paper copies on request | Ensure policy is consistent with notices and actual practices |

### Implementation Notes for E-Commerce

In practice, CCPA compliance means integrating opt-out mechanisms into checkout, account settings, and marketing preference pages, and maintaining processes to authenticate and respond to consumer requests within statutory timelines. Sitewide banners or headers can provide the Notice at Collection; cart and account flows should remain consistent with the Privacy Policy. When honoring GPC, ensure technical integration actually stops sale/sharing across the stack. Firms should designate at least two methods for each major consumer right and avoid requiring account creation solely to exercise rights. Data minimization and role-based access are recommended to reduce the risk surface.[^10]

## Terms of Service (ToS) Considerations

Terms of Service for supplement e-commerce should do more than allocate risk; they should reflect the regulatory realities governing claims and privacy. A robust ToS begins with a medical advice disclaimer that clarifies that the site and its products are not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, and that consumers should consult a healthcare provider before use, especially if they have underlying health conditions or take medications. This disclaimer should be paired with a clear explanation that statements on the site have not been evaluated by FDA and that products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease—language that mirrors, but does not replace, the DSHEA disclaimer on product labels.[^1][^5]

ToS should also address user-generated content (UGC) moderation. Reviews and comments must be monitored for disease claims, exaggerated efficacy, or safety statements, and moderated or supplemented with disclosures where needed. Policies should prohibit unlawful or deceptive content and reserve the right to remove posts that make prohibited claims. Forward-looking statements (e.g., “improves mood”) should be qualified and tied to substantiation, and any implication of FDA approval must be prohibited. Finally, ToS should include intellectual property protections, disclaimers of reliance, limitation of liability, governing law, jurisdiction, and binding arbitration where appropriate. These provisions are consistent with FTC’s expectations for truthful advertising and disclosures and reduce the risk of consumer deception in interactive media.[^5]

## International Shipping Restrictions

International logistics add layers of compliance. Importers of food products, including dietary supplements, are responsible for ensuring that products are safe, sanitary, and labeled in accordance with U.S. requirements. All imported food is considered interstate commerce, and FDA may detain shipments that do not comply. Exporters may be asked by foreign customers or governments to provide written certification, and FDA may provide certificates or maintain lists of eligible exporters for specific products or destinations; however, FDA does not require written certification for exports generally. The import for export (IFE) provisions in the FD&C Act allow certain temporary imports or re-exports under defined conditions.[^7][^8]

Importantly, FDA’s public guidance confirms responsibilities but does not detail country-specific import rules for the EU, UK, Canada, or Australia. Firms should consult destination-country regulatory authorities for specific import requirements (e.g., novel food status in the EU, health product licensing in the UK, natural health product rules in Canada, or complementary medicines in Australia). This is a key information gap to address before international launch.

### Practical Export/Import Checklist

The following steps can help operationalize FDA’s import/export responsibilities and avoid costly detentions or rejections:

- Confirm product identity and labeling compliance with U.S. requirements before export, including DSHEA disclaimers and Supplement Facts panels;[^7]
- Maintain batch records and certificates of analysis to support quality claims and facilitate destination-country inspections;[^7]
- Assess whether the destination requires any certifications, plant listings, or health certificates and coordinate with FDA or local authorities as needed;[^7]
- For U.S. re-export scenarios, review whether IFE provisions apply;[^7]
- Track destination-country import rules (e.g., EU novel food, UK health product authorization, Canada NHP licensing, Australia TGA listings) and ensure that formulations, labels, and marketing align before shipping.

## Risk Assessment and Enforcement Patterns

Both FDA and FTC have authority to act when supplement marketing overreaches. FDA enforcement often targets disease claims on labels or in labeling, misbranding, and CGMP violations. FTC enforcement frequently addresses deceptive advertising, inadequate substantiation, testimonial abuses, and misleading disclosures or omissions. Traditional use claims for serious conditions are particularly risky because they invite deception even when qualified; advertisers must clearly communicate the historic nature of the use, ensure product consistency with historical preparations, and disclose the lack of modern scientific evidence. If a claim cannot be made without misleading consumers, the claim should be removed or rephrased.[^5][^2][^1]

The following table maps common risks to controls that reduce exposure.

Table 5. Risk-to-Control Mapping

| Risk | Legal Exposure | Control |
|---|---|---|
| Disease claims (explicit or implied) | FDA drug misbranding; FTC deceptive advertising | Claims review SOP; pre-publication approvals; ban list of disease terms; legal review for mental-health phrasing |
| Overstated efficacy or certainty | FTC deceptive advertising | Substantiation library; copy standards that avoid absolute terms; disclosure of study limitations |
| Safety risks not disclosed | FTC deceptive omission | Safety assessment; safety disclosures in ads (dose, populations, interactions) |
| Misuse of testimonials or endorsements | FTC deceptive endorsements | Typical results disclosures; endorser qualification checks; clear and conspicuous material connection disclosures |
| Suggesting FDA approval | FTC deceptive advertising; FDA misbranding | Prohibit “FDA-approved” language; DSHEA disclaimer only on labels; periodic audits |
| Inconsistent DSHEA disclaimer | FDA labeling violation | Label QA checklists; symbol linking to disclaimer; typesize and prominence checks |
| CGMP deficiencies | FDA enforcement; product recalls | 21 CFR Part 111 compliance program; supplier qualification; stability and release testing |
| Privacy noncompliance (CCPA/COPPA) | CCPA enforcement; FTC COPPA enforcement | GPC integration; opt-out and rights processes; children’s data controls; audits |

### Mental-Health–Specific Risks

Mental-health positioning is inherently sensitive. References to “stress,” “worry,” or “sleep” can be acceptable if framed as support for normal function, but the net impression must not imply treatment of a psychiatric condition. Firms should test consumer understanding of claims and disclosures, including through copy research where appropriate, and should avoid suggestive imagery (e.g., clinical settings, pills dissolving in the brain) that implies disease effects. Clear and conspicuous disclosures—such as limits on population or dose—should accompany claims wherever the evidence does not match the implied breadth of benefit. If disclosures cannot neutralize the risk, claims should be revised or removed.[^5]

## Implementation Checklist and Templates

- Label elements
  - Supplement Facts panel with serving size, servings per container, amounts per serving, %DV where applicable; “Other ingredients” list; net quantity; domestic address/phone for reporting serious adverse events.[^2]
  - DSHEA disclaimer verbatim on labels bearing structure/function, well-being, or deficiency disease claims; symbol linking where not adjacent; boldface type no smaller than 1/16 inch; boxed format if not adjacent.[^1]
- Claim review SOP
  - Screen all labels, product pages, social media, influencer content, and PR before publication; require legal/compliance sign-off; maintain a ban list of disease terms and disallowed phrasing; include “mental health” term check; track substantiation for each claim.[^2][^5]
- FDA 30-day notification workflow
  - Prepare claim text, product and ingredient names, and responsible individual signature; log submission date; maintain copies; ensure DSHEA disclaimer is present and compliant.[^1][^15]
- Privacy implementation
  - Notice at Collection on homepage and order pages; Privacy Policy with rights, methods, and timelines; GPC honoring; opt-out link if selling/sharing personal information; deletion/correction processes; verification steps; non-discrimination commitments.[^10]

- Documentation
  - Batch records, COAs, stability data, substantiation library for claims; safety disclosures; audit logs for approvals; training records for claims review and privacy rights handling.[^4][^5]

## Information Gaps and Open Items

- FDA structure/function claim notification: this guide references the existence and timing in 21 CFR 101.93 and the FDA notifications guidance; firms should consult the FDA notifications page for the precise submission format and any templates.[^1][^15]
- HIPAA: this guide provides a high-level perspective and notes that HIPAA generally does not apply to retail supplement sellers; firms should consult counsel or the HHS guidance for sector-specific interpretations.[^10]
- State age restrictions: this guide references recent trends in a few states but does not list all state laws; businesses should track legislation and retail enforcement locally.[^14]
- Ingredient-specific restrictions: mental-health herbs such as St. John’s wort, kava, or melatonin may trigger additional constraints; consult FDA and other federal or state resources to build a risk-based ingredient watchlist. This is an open item for follow-up.
- International import rules: EU/UK/Canada/Australia import requirements are not detailed in the FDA page; destination country regulatory guidance should be obtained before international shipments.[^7]
