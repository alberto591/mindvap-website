# Safety Considerations, Contraindications, and Proper Usage Guidelines for Vaping Herbs for Mental Health

## Executive Summary and Scope

This report provides evidence-based guidance on vaping herbs for mental-health-related purposes such as relaxation, anxiety reduction, and sleep support. It synthesizes safety profiles for commonly used herbs, device and temperature practices to reduce exposure to harmful compounds, and regulatory and sourcing standards to mitigate contamination risks. The analysis integrates authoritative summaries from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), the World Health Organization (WHO), and peer-reviewed literature on vaping toxicology and device safety.

Key takeaways:
- Regulatory status: No vaping products are approved by the FDA to prevent, treat, or mitigate any health conditions or diseases. Claims to the contrary have prompted enforcement actions. Consumers should avoid products marketed with unproven health promises and report adverse events through FDA MedWatch.[^1]
- Device and combustion risk mitigation: Vaporization can reduce combustion toxins relative to smoking but is not risk-free. Aerosols may contain carbonyls, volatile organics, nitrosamines, and heavy metals. Device temperature control, maintenance, and material choices (e.g., coil/mouthpiece composition) are critical to minimizing exposure.[^2]
- Herb safety: Evidence for aromatherapeutic and oral use of herbs such as lavender, chamomile, passionflower, and valerian is varying in quality and quantity, with inhalation-specific data limited. Safety profiles and contraindications are clearer for oral routes than for vaping. For example, kava carries significant liver toxicity risks; passionflower is contraindicated in pregnancy; valerian is associated with rare hepatotoxicity; St. John’s wort has extensive drug interactions and psychiatric cautions.[^3][^4][^5][^6][^7][^8][^9]
- Temperature and session practices: Lower temperatures (e.g., 160–177°C) favor flavor and reduce harshness, while moderate temperatures (177–204°C) balance vapor production and compound activation. Excessive heat increases toxins and metal leaching. Stepwise temperature increases and convection-dominant devices improve safety and consistency.[^10][^2]
- Quality and sourcing: Adherence to FDA Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), contaminant standards (heavy metals, pesticides), and WHO good agricultural and collection practices reduces risk. Third-party testing and device selection to minimize metal release (nickel, chromium, lead) are essential.[^11][^12][^13][^14]
- Populations to avoid: Pregnant and breastfeeding individuals should avoid kava, passionflower, and St. John’s wort. Children, older adults, and people with liver disease, psychiatric conditions, or poly-pharmacy should consult clinicians and often avoid these herbs entirely.[^3][^4][^5][^7][^8][^9]

Scope and information gaps: Clinical evidence specific to inhalation of many herbs (e.g., chamomile, lavender, lemon balm) is limited, with most data derived from oral or topical uses. The optimal vaporization temperatures and doses for mental-health effects lack standardized, herb-specific clinical guidance; terpene charts are often manufacturer-driven. Heavy metals data mostly reflect cannabis vaping devices, but implications likely extend to herbal vaporization through shared device architectures. Consumers and professionals should interpret recommendations within these constraints.

## Methodology and Source Quality

This report privileges regulatory authorities (FDA, WHO), government health information (NCCIH), and peer-reviewed literature addressing vaping toxicology and device safety. Industry blogs are referenced selectively for temperature guidance and operational best practices and are triangulated against scientific and regulatory sources. The temporal baseline is current as of November 8, 2025.

- Authoritative anchors: FDA consumer protection communications and enforcement actions provide regulatory guardrails.[^1][^14][^15][^16] WHO materials inform quality, safety, and pharmacovigilance expectations for traditional and complementary medicine products.[^11][^12]
- Vaping literature: Reviews of vaporization products and device contaminants, including metal leaching and aerosol toxicants, frame inhalation risk mitigation.[^2][^13]
- Herb-specific safety: NCCIH monographs summarize evidence and safety for lavender, chamomile, and passionflower, while clinical hepatotoxicity references address valerian and kava. St. John’s wort drug interaction and psychiatric risk summaries come from major medical centers and clinical reviews.[^3][^4][^5][^6][^7][^8][^9][^17]

The report acknowledges limitations: inhalation-specific clinical data for several herbs is sparse; temperature charts for terpenes and “herbal” vaporization often originate from non-peer-reviewed sources; and heavy metals evidence, while robust for nicotine and cannabis devices, must be cautiously extrapolated to herbal vaporization.

## Regulatory and Safety Landscape for Herbal Vaping

FDA has been explicit: no vaping products are approved to prevent or treat any health condition or disease. The agency has issued warning letters to firms marketing “wellness” vapes with unproven claims, including products containing vitamins or essential oils. Consumers are urged to stop use and report adverse events via MedWatch. FDA also monitors misbranded and unauthorized products, including those making unlawful therapeutic claims.[^1][^14][^15][^16]

WHO emphasizes that traditional and complementary medicine products should be integrated into health systems only if they meet standards of quality, safety, and efficacy, supported by rigorous testing and pharmacovigilance. Heavy metals, pesticides, and contamination risks are documented concerns, underscoring the need for good manufacturing and agricultural practices.[^11][^12]

Public health agencies warn that vaping can expose users to harmful chemicals and metals, and that dependence and respiratory risks are real. Device design, temperature control, and maintenance materially influence exposure.[^18][^13]

To illustrate the enforcement context and risk categories, Table 1 summarizes selected FDA actions.

Table 1. FDA enforcement actions related to vaping products with health claims

| Company/Product                                       | Date         | Violation type                                   | Key warning themes                                                                 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Eagle Energy USA, Inc. (“Caffeine Pen”)               | Dec 1, 2021  | Unlawful health claims for a vaping product      | No approvals to treat conditions; inhaled products can be dangerous; report adverse events.[^1] |

Enforcement actions highlight consistent themes: unlawful disease claims, unknown safety profiles of inhaled formulations, and the importance of adverse event reporting. Consumers and manufacturers should align practices with FDA guidance to avoid misbranding and to protect public health.

## Inhalation Risk Science: Devices, Emissions, and Temperature

Vaporization reduces exposure to combustion toxins compared with smoking, yet it is not benign. Aerosols from vaporizers may contain carbonyls, volatile organic compounds, nitrosamines, and heavy metals, with device design and operating conditions playing a pivotal role in emission profiles.[^2] High-potency concentrate use and device malfunctions have been implicated in acute lung injury (EVALI), and low perceived risk among youth has contributed to uptake and co-use with nicotine.[^19]

Temperature control is central: higher temperatures increase the release of volatile compounds and can catalyze the formation of reactive species. Lower temperatures preserve flavor and reduce harshness but may under-extract desired aromatics. Practically, stepwise temperature increases during a session help balance extraction, sensory quality, and safety.[^10][^2]

Heavy metals in devices represent a cross-cutting risk. Metals such as nickel, chromium, lead, cadmium, and copper can leach from heating elements, atomizers, and mouthpieces into the liquid and aerosol, especially at high temperatures or with acidic formulations. Nanosized aerosol particles deposit deeply in the respiratory tract, raising concerns for lung, cardiovascular, and neurologic toxicity.[^13] Public-facing health resources enumerate additional aerosol components (e.g., tin, cadmium) and respiratory irritants, reinforcing the need for device maintenance and cautious use.[^18]

Table 2 provides a device-focused view of heavy metals, typical sources, health implications, and mitigation factors.

Table 2. Heavy metals in vaping devices: sources and health implications

| Metal | Device/source pathways | Health implications (selected) | Factors increasing release |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nickel (Ni) | Heating coils, atomizers, battery contacts | Respiratory irritation, inflammation, potential carcinogenicity; sinusitis, lung fibrosis with nanoparticles.[^13] | High temperature; dry heating; acidic oils; repeated heating/cooling cycles.[^13] |
| Chromium (Cr) | Coil alloys, filaments, mouthpiece metals | Respiratory irritation, decreased lung function, asthma risk; DNA damage with Cr oxide nanoparticles; cancer risk.[^13][^18] | High temperature; terpenated vs. unterpenated oil chemistry; device age and corrosion.[^13] |
| Lead (Pb) | Leaching into liquids; mouthpiece; solder joints | Neurologic toxicity (cognitive deficits), cardiovascular inflammation, carcinogenicity; anemia, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity.[^13] | Low liquid levels; high temperature; acidic formulations; storage time and oxidation.[^13] |
| Cadmium (Cd) | Coil materials; contaminated liquids | Atherosclerosis, hypertension, renal toxicity; carcinogenic potential.[^13] | High temperature; oxidation; degraded components; environmental contamination.[^13] |
| Copper (Cu) | Coil cores, mouthpieces, wiring | Respiratory irritation, pulmonary inflammation; contributes to oxidative stress.[^13] | Heat exposure; acidity; prolonged use without cleaning.[^13] |

These findings argue for conservative temperature settings, routine device cleaning, avoidance of dry hits, and selection of devices with coil and pathway materials less prone to leaching (e.g., ceramics, high-quality alloys). While most metal studies focus on nicotine and cannabis devices, the same hardware configurations are often used for herbal vaporization, warranting comparable precautions.[^2][^13]

## Herb-Specific Safety Profiles (Mental Health Focus)

Evidence for inhalation delivery of herbs commonly used for relaxation, anxiety, and sleep is limited; most data derive from oral, topical, or aromatherapy use. Safety and interaction profiles are accordingly more robust for these routes than for vaping. The following herb summaries emphasize known risks, contraindications, and inhalation-relevant cautions.

### Kava (Piper methysticum)

Kava is traditionally used for anxiolysis. However, kavalactones inhibit multiple enzymes, and the herb is associated with rare but serious hepatotoxicity, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure, even with short-term use. Interactions with alcohol and sedatives potentiate CNS depression and liver risk. Regulatory actions in Europe and Canada have at times removed kava from the market due to liver toxicity concerns; it has never been FDA-approved for medicinal use.[^7][^20][^21][^22][^23]

- Key risks: Hepatotoxicity (dose-independent reports), additive sedation with alcohol and CNS depressants, impairment of reaction times.
- Contraindications: Liver disease, pregnancy, breastfeeding; avoid in children.
- Precautions: Review medications to avoid enzyme-inhibition interactions; discontinue before surgery; monitor for liver symptoms (e.g., jaundice, dark urine).
- Inhalation note: Evidence for safety and efficacy via vaporization is limited; liver and interaction risks are sufficient to warrant avoidance unless a clinician explicitly advises otherwise.

Table 3 organizes hepatotoxicity case features from selected sources.

Table 3. Kava hepatotoxicity: case features and regulatory context

| Feature | Summary |
|---|---|
| Severity | Reports of fatal liver injury; hepatitis, cirrhosis, and acute liver failure documented.[^21] |
| Latency | Variable; liver injury reported even with short-term use (1–3 months).[^20] |
| Patterns | Hepatocellular and cholestatic injury patterns reported; severe outcomes documented in case series.[^20][^21] |
| Regulatory actions | Withdrawn or restricted in several European countries and Canada; later reconsidered in some jurisdictions; never FDA-approved.[^20][^22] |
| Interaction context | Additive CNS depression with alcohol and sedatives; enzyme inhibition interactions with multiple medications.[^21][^23] |

The weight of evidence supports extreme caution and generally avoidance of kava, particularly via inhalation given the lack of inhalation safety data.

### Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia)

Lavender is widely used in aromatherapy and as an oral supplement for anxiety. NCCIH summarizes that aromatherapy with lavender oil is “possibly safe,” with side effects including headache and coughing; topical products may cause allergic skin reactions. Little is known about safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and theoretical interactions with sedatives warrant caution.[^3]

- Key risks: Headache, cough with inhalation; skin sensitization with topical use; theoretical sedation interaction.
- Contraindications: None firmly established; caution in pregnancy, breastfeeding, and concurrent sedatives.
- Inhalation note: While aromatherapy is generally considered possibly safe, vaping essential oils poses distinct risks (see Essential Oils section). Use dry herb formulations and moderate temperatures to reduce airway irritation.

### Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla / Chamaemelum nobile)

Chamomile is commonly consumed as tea and used in supplements. NCCIH indicates it is likely safe orally in food amounts, with uncommon side effects such as nausea and dizziness. Case reports of allergic reactions exist, especially in individuals sensitive to Asteraceae family plants. Chamomile may interact with sedatives and antiplatelet drugs, increasing drowsiness or bleeding risk.[^4][^24]

- Key risks: Allergic reactions, drowsiness when combined with sedatives; potential antiplatelet interactions.
- Contraindications: Known hypersensitivity to chamomile or related plants.
- Inhalation note: Inhalation-specific evidence is limited; avoid high-temperature sessions that may increase irritation.

### Passionflower (Passiflora incarnata)

Passionflower is used for anxiety and sleep. NCCIH and clinical monographs advise avoidance during pregnancy due to uterine stimulant effects. Common side effects include drowsiness and dizziness. Passionflower may interact with anesthesia and other sedatives, and discontinuation at least two weeks before surgery is recommended.[^5][^25]

- Key risks: Drowsiness, dizziness; uterine stimulation in pregnancy.
- Contraindications: Pregnancy; caution with sedatives and perioperative contexts.
- Inhalation note: Given the lack of inhalation safety data and pregnancy risks, use should be avoided in pregnancy and coordinated with surgical care.

### Valerian (Valeriana officinalis)

Valerian is widely used for insomnia. LiverTox documents rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury, typically mild-to-moderate and self-limiting, often in combination with other botanicals. Side effects are generally mild and transient, including sedation and dizziness. GABAergic mechanisms suggest additive CNS depression with sedatives and alcohol.[^6][^26]

- Key risks: Rare hepatotoxicity; sedation; potential withdrawal-like symptoms on abrupt cessation.
- Contraindications: No explicit contraindications listed; caution with sedatives, alcohol, and hepatotoxic combinations.
- Inhalation note: Clinical data for inhalation are limited; conservative temperature use and avoidance of combination products with unclear hepatotoxic potential are prudent.

Table 4. Valerian hepatotoxicity characteristics

| Feature | Summary |
|---|---|
| Frequency | Rare; valerian considered an uncommon cause of clinically apparent liver injury given wide use.[^6] |
| Onset | Typically 3–12 weeks after starting use; recovery 2–4 months after cessation.[^6] |
| Pattern | Hepatocellular or mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic; usually mild-to-moderate severity; self-limiting.[^6] |
| Context | Often implicated in combination products; causality sometimes unclear due to co-ingredients.[^6] |

### St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum)

St. John’s wort is used for mild depression but carries extensive drug interactions mediated by cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein pathways. It can induce mania in bipolar disorder, worsen psychosis in schizophrenia, and interact with serotonergic drugs to increase serotonin levels. It is possibly unsafe during pregnancy and breastfeeding and requires discontinuation before surgery due to anesthetic and serotonin interactions.[^8][^9][^27]

- Key risks: Reduced effectiveness of many medications (e.g., contraceptives, immunosuppressants, antivirals, anticoagulants); photosensitivity; psychiatric exacerbation in vulnerable patients.
- Contraindications: Pregnancy, breastfeeding; bipolar disorder, major depression with manic features, schizophrenia; concurrent serotonergic therapy without careful oversight.
- Inhalation note: Avoid entirely given robust interaction profiles and psychiatric risks; oral use should only proceed under strict medical supervision.

### Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis) and Aromatic Mints (Mentha spp.)

Evidence for inhalation-specific safety and dosing is limited. While oral use of lemon balm is generally well-tolerated, essential oil inhalation via vaping is not recommended by respiratory health organizations due to airway irritation risk. Users seeking minty aromatics should prefer low-temperature sessions with dry herb formulations and be vigilant for cough or wheeze.[^28][^13][^18]

- Key risks: Airway irritation, cough, wheeze, especially with essential oil vaping; limited data for inhalation delivery.
- Contraindications: Asthma or reactive airway disease; children and older adults may be more sensitive.
- Inhalation note: Avoid essential oil cartridges; prefer dry herb formats and low temperatures; monitor respiratory symptoms.

## Potential Side Effects and Drug–Herb Interactions

Across herbs used for mental health, sedation and drowsiness are the most common side effects. Allergic reactions occur with chamomile, particularly in those sensitized to Asteraceae. Kava’s major concern is hepatotoxicity, especially with alcohol or other hepatotoxic agents. St. John’s wort’s broad enzyme induction results in decreased plasma levels of many medications, increasing failure rates of contraceptives, immunosuppressants, antivirals, and anticoagulants, among others; serotonergic interactions raise the risk of excessive serotonin.[^7][^8][^9]

Table 5 catalogs interaction categories and clinical implications for commonly vaped herbs in this context.

Table 5. Interaction categories and clinical implications

| Interaction category | Herbs implicated | Clinical implications |
|---|---|---|
| Sedatives (benzodiazepines, sleep aids, anticonvulsants) | Kava, Valerian, Passionflower, Lavender (theoretical) | Additive CNS depression; impaired cognition and psychomotor performance; avoid driving; consider dose reduction under medical guidance.[^7][^6][^5][^3] |
| Anesthesia/perioperative medications | Passionflower, St. John’s wort | Increased sedation; serotonin and anesthetic interactions; discontinue at least 2 weeks before surgery.[^5][^8] |
| Hepatotoxic agents (alcohol, other herbals) | Kava, Valerian (rare cases) | Elevated risk of liver injury; avoid concurrent use; monitor for jaundice, dark urine.[^7][^6] |
| Cytochrome P450 substrates (e.g., contraceptives, antivirals, immunosuppressants, anticoagulants) | St. John’s wort | Reduced medication levels and effectiveness; breakthrough bleeding with contraceptives; increased clotting risk for warfarin; requires dose adjustment and monitoring.[^8][^9][^27] |
| Photosensitizing agents | St. John’s wort | Increased risk of sunburn and skin reactions; use sun protection.[^8] |
| Antiplatelet/anticoagulant drugs | Chamomile (theoretical) | Potential increased bleeding risk; monitor closely.[^4][^24] |

Inhalation may theoretically amplify drug delivery and systemic exposure, but clinical quantification is limited. Given the variability in device temperatures, plant chemistry, and individual sensitivities, the safest approach is to avoid combining sedating herbs with sedating medications, to discontinue agents with major interaction potential (e.g., St. John’s wort) before initiating vaping, and to involve clinicians in all poly-pharmacy scenarios.

## Dosage and Administration Guidelines

There is no validated, herb-specific dosing framework for inhalation. Most evidence is derived from oral or topical use, and terpene temperature charts are often manufacturer- or industry-driven. Consequently, this report emphasizes session-based practices—temperature control, draw technique, and device hygiene—over numeric dose.

Temperature zones and session practices: 
- Low zone (160–177°C): Maximizes flavor, minimizes harshness, preserves terpenes. Suitable for first-time users or daytime sessions requiring clear-headed effects.
- Medium zone (177–204°C): Balanced extraction and vapor production. A practical “sweet spot” for regular users.
- High zone (204–221°C): Dense vapor and complete extraction but higher risk of harshness and increased emissions. Use cautiously and only as needed.[^10][^2]

Stepwise temperature increases from a moderate starting point allow progressive activation of aromatics while avoiding combustion and device stress. Convection-dominant devices facilitate even extraction and reduce hot spots. Visual and taste cues matter: golden-brown residue indicates appropriate extraction; dark brown/black suggests overheating; green indicates under-extraction.[^10]

Table 6 offers a temperature guide, triangulated with scientific caution.

Table 6. Temperature zone guide and operational cautions

| Zone | Temperature range (°C) | Expected effects | Operational cautions |
|---|---|---|---|
| Low | 160–177 | Light, flavorful vapor; mild aromatics; minimal harshness | May under-extract; slowly increase temperature if needed; use convection for even heating.[^10] |
| Medium | 177–204 | Balanced vapor density; primary terpene activation; efficient sessions | Preferred daily range; maintain device cleanliness for accurate temperature readings.[^10] |
| High | 204–221 | Dense vapor; full extraction; immediate sensory impact | Elevated emissions (carbonyls,潜在 toxins); metal leaching increases with heat; avoid dry hits; consider short sessions.[^2][^10] |

Essential oil inhalation: The American Lung Association advises against vaping essential oils, citing airway inflammation and respiratory symptoms. If aromatherapy is desired, consider diffusers or topical application (with appropriate dilution), not vaporization. For herbs like lavender or mint, dry herb vaporization at conservative temperatures is preferable to essential oil cartridges.[^13][^3]

Session logging supports reproducibility and safety: record starting and ending temperatures, draw cadence, flavor quality, vapor production, and perceived effects. A log helps identify the minimal effective temperature for desired outcomes, reducing exposure risks over time.[^10]

## Best Practices for Herbal Vaping

A comprehensive best-practices checklist follows, integrating device hygiene, draw technique, session planning, and monitoring. These practices reduce exposure to contaminants and mitigate acute respiratory irritation.

- Device selection: Favor convection-dominant devices and materials less prone to metal leaching; prefer ceramic pathways and high-quality alloys. Avoid low-quality disposables with unclear coil composition.[^2][^13][^18]
- Preparation: Use properly cured, dry herbs with consistent grind. Pack loosely to allow airflow; avoid over-tamping in convection devices. Preheat and maintain clean pathways for accurate temperature control.[^10]
- Temperature control: Start at 177–190°C and step up within session as needed. Avoid dry hits; replace material when flavor shifts to “burnt” or “popcorn-like.” Use cooling stems or water filtration to reduce harshness.[^10]
- Session hygiene: Clean chambers and stems regularly. Replace worn coils and gaskets. Monitor device behavior for erratic temperature readings or unusual tastes, which can signal contamination or degradation.[^10][^13]
- Monitoring: Track onset, duration, and intensity of effects. Note any respiratory symptoms (cough, wheeze) or cognitive impairment. Discontinue use and seek medical advice for adverse reactions.[^1][^18]

Table 7. Practical safety checklist for herbal vaping

| Domain | Action items |
|---|---|
| Device | Convection-dominant; ceramic pathways; known coil alloys; avoid dry hits; inspect for corrosion. |
| Material | Dry, cured herbs; medium grind; avoid essential oil cartridges for airway safety. |
| Temperature | Start moderate; step up; avoid >221°C; log settings and effects. |
| Hygiene | Clean stems/chambers; replace worn parts; store in cool, dry place. |
| Behavior | Slow, steady draws; avoid forceful inhalation; limit session length. |
| Monitoring | Watch for cough, wheeze, dizziness, sedation; cease use and seek care for severe symptoms. |

## Quality and Sourcing Considerations

Quality systems reduce contamination risks—pesticides, heavy metals, residual solvents—and ensure label accuracy. FDA’s cGMP for dietary supplements establishes manufacturing standards, while contaminant guidance and inspection programs address heavy metals, pesticides, and natural toxins. WHO guidelines provide global benchmarks for good manufacturing and agricultural practices and for safety monitoring (pharmacovigilance). Heavy metals in devices add a second vector of exposure; selecting devices with low-leach materials and maintaining them properly are essential.[^11][^12][^14][^15][^13]

Table 8. Sourcing and quality standards matrix

| Standard/guidance | Scope | Key requirements | Applicability to vaping |
|---|---|---|---|
| FDA cGMP (Dietary Supplements) | Manufacturing practices | Identity, purity, strength, batch records, quality control; recall authority; inspections.[^14] | Ensures herb powders/blends are correctly labeled and free of contaminants. |
| FDA contaminant guidance (chemicals, metals, pesticides) | Contaminant limits and testing | Specifications for heavy metals, pesticides, natural toxins; manufacturer responsibility to validate limits.[^15] | Justifies third-party COAs for herb materials used in vaporization. |
| FDA inspection program (CP 7321.008) | Compliance oversight | Inspections for foreign/domestic supplements; enforcement actions against violations.[^12] | Encourages sourcing from compliant manufacturers; reduces misbranding risk. |
| WHO GMP for herbal medicines | Global manufacturing | Quality systems for herbal medicines; documentation and validation.[^11] | Cross-jurisdictional benchmark; helpful for international suppliers. |
| WHO GACP for medicinal plants | Agriculture/collection | Good agricultural and collection practices to prevent contamination.[^11] | Reduces pesticide/heavy metal burden at the source. |
| WHO pharmacovigilance | Safety monitoring | Systems to detect and act on adverse events for T&CM products.[^11] | Supports post-market surveillance and rapid corrective action. |
| Device metal leaching literature | Vaping hardware | Identifies leached metals (Ni, Cr, Pb, Cd, Cu) and operating conditions that increase release.[^13] | Informs device selection and temperature practices to minimize inhalation exposure. |

Consumers should seek suppliers providing Certificates of Analysis (COAs) from independent labs for heavy metals, pesticides, and microbial contaminants. Avoid products with vague labeling or extraordinary health claims. For devices, prefer reputable brands that disclose coil materials and pathway design and publish safety testing.

## Populations Who Should Avoid Certain Herbs

Certain populations should avoid or exercise heightened caution with herbs used for mental health, especially via inhalation where data are limited. Pregnancy and breastfeeding warrant avoidance of kava, passionflower, and St. John’s wort due to risks of liver toxicity, uterine stimulation, and unknown infant effects, respectively. Children and adolescents should avoid herbal vaping given respiratory and device risks and the lack of pediatric safety data. Individuals with liver disease should avoid kava and exercise caution with valerian. Psychiatric conditions (bipolar disorder, major depression, schizophrenia) present contraindications or cautions for St. John’s wort, and sedative叠加 should be avoided in older adults with poly-pharmacy.[^7][^5][^3][^8]

Table 9. Population-specific contraindications and cautions

| Population | Herbs to avoid/cautions | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Pregnancy | Kava; Passionflower; St. John’s wort | Liver toxicity risk (kava); uterine stimulation (passionflower); possible birth defects and infant colic/drowsiness (St. John’s wort).[^7][^5][^8] |
| Breastfeeding | Kava; St. John’s wort | Infant colic, drowsiness, fussiness; unknown safety for kava; extensive drug interactions for St. John’s wort.[^7][^8] |
| Children/adolescents | All herbal vapes; caution with essential oils | Lack of pediatric safety data; respiratory irritation and device risks; co-use with nicotine increases harm potential.[^18][^19] |
| Liver disease | Avoid kava; caution with valerian | Significant hepatotoxicity (kava); rare hepatotoxicity with valerian often in combination products.[^7][^6] |
| Psychiatric disorders (bipolar, schizophrenia, major depression) | St. John’s wort | Risk of mania or psychosis; serotoninergic interactions; anesthesia concerns.[^8][^9] |
| Older adults/poly-pharmacy | Sedating herbs (kava, valerian, passionflower, lavender) | Additive sedation; St. John’s wort interactions with many medications; fall risk.[^3][^6][^5][^8] |

The decision to vape any herb should be made in consultation with clinicians, particularly for people with comorbidities or complex medication regimens.

## Adverse Event Recognition and Response

Adverse events related to herbal vaping can manifest across respiratory, hepatic, neurologic, and allergic domains. Rapid recognition and action reduce harm.

- Respiratory: Cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, airway tightening. Discontinue use immediately and seek medical care if severe or persistent. Avoid essential oil vaping given airway inflammation risks.[^13][^1]
- Hepatic: Nausea, abdominal pain, itching, fatigue, dark urine, jaundice. Seek urgent evaluation; stop the herb; kava and valerian have documented hepatotoxicity signals.[^7][^6]
- Neurologic/psychiatric: Dizziness, excessive sedation, confusion; St. John’s wort may precipitate mania or psychosis in vulnerable patients; discontinue and consult a clinician.[^8]
- Allergic: Hives, swelling, anaphylaxis. Manage as a medical emergency; discontinue product; seek emergency care.[^5][^6]

Reporting: Consumers should report adverse events to FDA MedWatch. Keeping device and product information (brand, model, temperature settings, COAs) facilitates evaluation and regulatory follow-up. In clinical settings, clinicians should document temporal associations between vaping and symptoms, consider device contaminant exposures, and report through appropriate channels.[^1][^18][^13]

Table 10. Symptom-to-action guide

| Symptom category | Immediate action | When to seek care | Reporting steps |
|---|---|---|---|
| Respiratory (cough, wheeze, SOB) | Stop vaping; move to fresh air; hydrate | If symptoms worsen or persist; history of asthma/COPD | FDA MedWatch; include device and herb details.[^1][^18] |
| Hepatic (jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain) | Stop herb; avoid alcohol and sedatives | Immediate medical evaluation given potential liver injury | MedWatch report; document brand, batch, and COA if available.[^7][^6][^1] |
| Neurologic/psychiatric (excessive sedation, mania, confusion) | Discontinue; avoid driving; notify clinician | If symptoms escalate or impair function; history of psychiatric disorder | MedWatch report; consider drug–herb interaction review.[^8][^1] |
| Allergic (hives, swelling) | Discontinue; consider antihistamines | Any respiratory distress or systemic symptoms require emergency care | MedWatch report; include product and device details.[^5][^6][^1] |

| Manufacturing quality | FDA cGMP; WHO GMP | Ensures identity, purity, and correct labeling; reduces contamination risk.[^14][^11] |
| Contaminant limits | FDA contaminant guidance; state guidelines (heavy metals in inhaled medical cannabis) | Establishes testing benchmarks; informs COA verification.[^15][^13] |
| Agricultural practices | WHO GACP | Reduces pesticide and heavy metal uptake at the source.[^11] |
| Post-market safety | WHO pharmacovigilance; FDA inspections | Detects and mitigates adverse events and violations.[^11][^12] |
| Device materials | Heavy metals literature (Ni, Cr, Pb, Cd, Cu) | Guides device selection and temperature control to minimize leaching.[^13] |

Glossary:
- EVALI: E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury; acute respiratory illness linked to vaping, often related to contaminants or device misuse.[^19]
- Terpenes: Aromatic compounds in plants (e.g., linalool, limonene) that contribute to scent and potential effects; vaporize at different temperatures, with lower temperatures favoring flavor and higher temperatures increasing extraction and harshness.[^10]
- cGMP: Current Good Manufacturing Practices; FDA regulatory standards ensuring dietary supplement quality and compliance.[^14]
- COA: Certificate of Analysis; third-party lab report verifying contaminant testing (e.g., heavy metals, pesticides) and potency.
- P-gp: P-glycoprotein; a drug efflux transporter affecting medication levels; St. John’s wort can modulate P-gp function, altering drug exposure.[^8]

Acknowledgment of information gaps:
- Direct clinical evidence on inhalation safety and efficacy for many herbs (e.g., chamomile, lavender, lemon balm) remains limited, with most data from oral or topical uses.
- Herb-specific vaporization temperature thresholds and doses for mental health outcomes are not standardized; terpene charts used by industry are not definitive clinical guides.
- Heavy metals data primarily reflect nicotine/cannabis vaping; implications for herbal vaporization are inferred via shared device architectures and operating principles.
- Interaction profiles are often derived from oral use; additive risks of inhaled delivery in poly-pharmacy contexts remain insufficiently quantified.
- The cumulative risk of frequent sessions across weeks to months is not well characterized; more longitudinal observational data are needed.
